# Calculator
 - Create a Calculator. Use everything that you have learned from the prework tutorials.

- Create a very basic, 4 function calculator within a console application.

## Specs
- Upon completion, your calculator should contain the following:

- Inside the Program.cs file of your console application you should have 4 external methods plus the Main method:
  	- Add()
	- Subtract()
	- Multiply()
	- Divide()
- Each of these methods should take in 2 parameters, and return the solution of those 2 numbers. (i.e if you are adding 2 numbers than your return would be the sum of the 2 numbers added together. )

Output to the console the answer to the proposed math problem.
